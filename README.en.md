Aygaz Artificial Intelligence Literacy Bootcamp
A Bootcamp organized in cooperation with Koç Holding and within the scope of Aygaz W-Energy For Equality.

Project Details
What are the precautions that can be taken before or after an earthquake?

As Global AI Hub, with the earthquake disaster in our country, we thought about what we can do with you. In this sense, we will launch a use-case project where you can freely generate ideas at the Aygaz Artificial Intelligence Literacy Bootcamp. We expect you to create an idea explaining how earthquake disasters can be prevented or minimized with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. You can prepare your project as a presentation and in pdf format, either alone or in a team with bootcamp participants. Your project will be evaluated in terms of the idea you have created, the explanations in your presentations and effective presentation techniques, and the most successful project will be invited to the Global AI Hub Graduation broadcast and will be allowed to present the project.

1.Find a solution to the problem
For your project, you should first start by finding an answer to the question: What are the measures that can be taken before or after an earthquake? Research should be done from many sources and you should find a solution by bringing the results together. This solution will be your main idea in the project.

2. Develop your idea through research
Are there similar projects?
If there are similar projects, what are their shortcomings?
How can you fill the gaps?
By considering these questions, you will have identified your first experiences in the problem solving phase.
3.Develop your idea and make a presentation
Put your ideas into a presentation and remember to research and use effective presentation techniques.
4.Evaluation Stages of the Project
The following items will be considered as the evaluation phase. Please pay attention while doing your project.

Your idea
The value the idea will create
Sites or products from which ideas are inspired
Fluency and coherence of the presentation
Contents of the presentation
5.Project Delivery
The project should be added to GitHub in a presentation format with .pdf extension and the link should be shared with us. Link to the form to share the project: https://forms.gle/H4K8PGGKTMdradje6
Simply upload the project to GitHub and send us the link.
Projects will be done as a team or individually. The teams created should consist of a maximum of 5 people. You do not need to be in the same Bootcamp group when creating project groups.
You can add the GitHub link of your project to the form that will be sent to you by Global AI Hub.
Project Deadline: March 5, 2023 at 23:59
